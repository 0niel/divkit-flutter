**DivKit** üêã is an open source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework.
It allows you to roll out server-sourced updates to different app versions. Also, it can be used for fast UI prototyping, allowing you to write a layout once and then ship it to iOS, Android, and Web platforms.
DivKit is an excellent choice to start using server-driven UI in your project because it can be easily integrated as a simple view in any part of your app. At the starting point, you don‚Äôt need a server integration. You can include all JSON on the client-side to try it in a real-world application.

Also, we‚Äôve made a [sandbox](https://divkit.tech/playground) for you to experiment with. You can try different samples in the web editor and see the results on the web or in the Android [demo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.divkit.demo), both of which are available on Google Play. We‚Äôll publish the iOS demo app shortly. The UI in the demo can be updated live: the sandbox connects to the demo app via web sockets. You can use the [DivKit website](https://divkit.tech/en) to find a lot of handy samples and documentation, but feel free to ask us anything here in the comments or via the [Telegram community chat](https://t.me/divkit_community_en).
